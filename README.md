## Overview

This Latex class extends the 'article' class to format
Scout Activity documents - those that describe things to do with 
(Squirrel)/Beaver/Cub Scouts, Scouts and (Explorer) scouts.

The `\part{}` command is overloaded and called by the new command
`\activitypart[]{}` which takes optional badge and text labels.

Please see the compiled example [PDF](./main.pdf) for full details.

This release contains the current Activity and Challenge badges for the
Beavers, Cubs and Scouts. Converted to SVG or redrawn as necessary using
inkscape to SVG and then exported to PDF for best suitability for PDFLaTeX.
The Squirrel and Explorer badges are a work in progress.

Fonts and Scout Association branding materials have been copied from my
other Scout Branding project https://github.com/nimpo/GreyWolfsScoutsBeamerTheme
